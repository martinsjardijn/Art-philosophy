## 📄 README: The Artificial Ready-Made

This repository contains the text of the proposition paper: **"The Artificial Ready-Made: GAI-Art in Light of Dickie and Danto."**

### Abstract

This paper posits that a work generated by Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI)—prompted by a text or a self-made drawing—can be considered a **ready-made** by the artist, thereby placing contemporary technological development within the revolutionary tradition of one of art history's most radical concepts.

By testing this proposition against the institutional theory of **George Dickie** and the philosophy of **Arthur Danto**, the paper argues the proposition is not only tenable but also remarkably illuminating for the status of GAI-art. It emphasizes that the artistic act no longer lies (solely) in the artisanal execution, but in the conceptual action of **selection, presentation, and meaning-making**.

### Key Philosophical Frameworks

* **Arthur Danto's "Artworld" and "Aboutness"**:
    * According to Danto, a theoretical context, rather than a visual distinction, determines what constitutes art.
    * The GAI artist functions as a **curator of possibilities**, where the prompt acts as the theoretical framework guiding the algorithm.
    * The subsequent selection of the GAI output is comparable to Marcel Duchamp choosing a bottle rack. The GAI output is anonymous and industrially (digitally) produced, becoming art through the meaning the artist bestows upon it (**aboutness**).
* **George Dickie's Institutional Theory of Art**:
    * A work of art is an artifact upon which a certain status has been conferred by someone acting on behalf of the **artworld**.
    * The GAI artist's action—entering the prompt, selecting the result, titling, signing, and exhibiting it—is a perfect illustration of this institutional conferral of status.
    * The prompt is considered the modern equivalent of Duchamp's signature on *Fountain*, transforming an algorithmically generated pixel configuration into a work of art.

### Conclusion

The paper concludes that the GAI-art as a ready-made proposition strips the discussion of technological mystification and places it within a robust philosophical framework. The entire process—conception (prompt), generation (by GAI), and institutional ratification (selection and presentation)—constitutes the work of art.

The GAI artist is thus a **hunter-gatherer in a digital environment**, who "finds" ready-made images and elevates them to art through the act of selection and presentation. In this way, the spirit of Duchamp is very much alive in the age of the algorithm.
